## CPSC 120

* Lab 4, part 1
Lab 4, Part 1 was enjoyable because it allowed me to discover how unit conversions work for programming. I applied
different conversion functions and tested them, which helped me understand the idea of function creation.
The process of debugging and refining these functions enhanced my understanding of how to structure code that focuses
on accuracy. This assignment helped me realize the importance of having detailed testing and allowed me to value
the implementations of unit conversions for programming.

* Lab 10 
Lab 10 was one of my favorites because I worked with a 2D vector to store and process  California's county data.
I applied different functions to search through the data and compute population percentages in each county.
This lab helped improve my understanding of data structures specifically in 2D vectors and modular programming for
controlling complex data efficiently. 

* Lab 11, part 2
Lab 11, part 2 was engaging since I got to experience working on implementing the State class to process input
demographic data. The task focused on Calculating population densities for different states and processing input
from CSV files. This enhanced my understanding of object-based programming specifically in class design and file
handling while improving my ability to analyze real-world data effectively. The assignment strengthened my data
processing approaches and advanced my skills in modular programming.
